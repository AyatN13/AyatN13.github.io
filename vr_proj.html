        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p>The goal of this project was to create a basic VR application on Unity, for the VR Oculus Quest 2 headset. First, I had to download Oculus Developer Hub, which I then accessed in Unity. Following Johabâ€™s YouTube video, I set the settings of a VR template correctly and created the left and right controller. I then dove right into creating the actual shapes/design. I chose to create a Minecraft creeper, as it was something I felt confident doing on my first attempt at making a VR program - since it was working with one simple shape (a cube), and easily placing them accordingly. It was really fun being able to learn how to make each cube hold a color/print and resize them to look good on the application.</p>
