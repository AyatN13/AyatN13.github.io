            <p>
                In a collaborative effort, we developed an AR application in Unity that overlays images inspired by nature and wildlife onto a tracked image. The project was a learning experience filled with challenges, such as adjusting object sizes, configuring the AR camera, and troubleshooting issues related to image tracking and object rendering. The final product successfully displays 3D objects when the camera hovers over the reference image, creating an engaging augmented reality experience.
