            <p>
                Our project was created by situating the circuit board and LED lights on the bottom of the stairwell on the first floor. The circuit was attached to one of the baseboards near the door to accurately detect the sound of the door closing. LED lights were placed along the floor panels lining the stairs, creating an upward-traveling light effect. The lights transition to a light purple color after detecting the sound, accompanied by a short audio clip. The projectâ€™s location is crucial for its functionality, as it depends on the specific sound threshold set for the stairwell. The immersive installation was designed to engage users in a frequently used space, enhancing the environment through interactive technology.
