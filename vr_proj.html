            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of this project was to create a basic VR application for the Oculus Quest 2 headset using Unity. The project involved setting up a VR environment and designing a Minecraft-inspired character. The process included configuring the Oculus Developer Hub in Unity, creating VR controllers, and assembling the 3D environment. This hands-on experience with VR development not only enhanced my understanding of Unity but also opened up new possibilities for future virtual reality projects.
