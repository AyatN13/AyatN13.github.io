        <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
        <p>Our project was created by situating the circuit board and LED lights on the bottom of the stairwell on the first floor. We put the actual circuit on the front of one of the baseboards closest to the door, so it would detect the sound of the door closing accurately. Next, we taped the LED lights on top of the floor panels lining the stairs, so that the lights would look like they are traveling upward. Lastly, we made sure that the battery was properly attached, secured, and hidden with the addition of a small, white box so that no wires were exposed.</p>
        <p>As for the functionality of our project, the lights are set to transition into a light purple color after a loud sound (the door closing) is detected by the circuit. A short audio clip will also be played three times immediately after the initial sound detection. If the stairwell is quiet, as if no one is coming in or out of the door, the LEDs will continuously shine a pale blue color on the actual board (with the LEDs not lit at all), and won’t play any sound.</p>
        <p>We chose this location because we thought it would be easy to insert an immersive work into an area used by many people. This stairwell supports our project because our program is dependent on the sound of the door closing for it to work appropriately. It’s also necessary that the project is located in this specific site because the sound threshold is set to a certain level (one that has been adapted to this exact location), and needs the sound of the door closing at that specific site in order to function. So, if our project was moved to a different place, the sound of certain doors closing may be too quiet to trigger the LEDs and sound detector, and the program would not work correctly.</p>
